My QF honours thesis completed in 2019.

Thesis revolved around simulating a VIX for BTC and understanding the observations acquired.
1. Constructed a Volatility Index using BTC vanilla options.
2. Experimented constructing VIX for BTC with inverse options instead.
3. Back-tested if the self constructed VIX can be used for hedging BTC volatility.
